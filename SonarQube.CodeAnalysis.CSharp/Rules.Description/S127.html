<p>
    <code>for</code> loop stop conditions must be invariant (i.e. true at both the beginning and ending of every loop iteration). Ideally, this means that the stop condition is set to a local variable just before the loop begins.
</p>
<p>
    Stop conditions that are not invariant are difficult to understand and maintain, and will likely lead to the introduction of errors in the future.
</p>
<p>
    This rule tracks three types of non-invariant stop conditions:
    <ul>
        <li>When the loop counters are updated in the body of the for loop</li>
        <li>When the stop condition depend upon a method call</li>
        <li>When the stop condition depends on an object property, since such properties could change during the execution of the loop.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<pre>
class Foo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i);
            if (condition)
            {
               i = 20;
           }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class Foo

    static void Main()
    {
